Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: That the teams with lower chances of winning not getting into the finals

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100 times is good enough if it is to bet if any of the top 3 are in the top 3 with no strict rules on the order
